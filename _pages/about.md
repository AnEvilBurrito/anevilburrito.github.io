I have a passion in data and its application to challenging problems. Through the increasing digitalisation of our world, I believe that understanding and harnassing the power of data is key to solving key problems and drive innovations. Coming from a background of both Biomedical and Computational Sciences, I am highly interested in the application of data science in the field of health and medicine.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University. My research focuses on the integration of mechanistic models and machine learning to predict drug response in cancer.
